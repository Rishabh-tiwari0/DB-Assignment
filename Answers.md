### Answer for Question 1:
The relationship between a product category and products is a "one-to-many" (1:N) relationship. This means that one product category can have multiple products associated with it, but each product is associated with only one product category. For example, a product category like "Electronics" can have multiple products such as smartphones, laptops, and cameras. Each product (e.g., a specific smartphone model) belongs to only one category (e.g., "Electronics"). This type of relationship allows for effective organization and categorization of products within a system, where products can be grouped under broader categories for easier management and browsing.

### Answer for Question 2:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can utilize a foreign key constraint in your database schema. This constraint ensures that the value stored in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table references an existing category in the "Product_Category" table. With this constraint in place, the database will enforce referential integrity, preventing the insertion or update of a product record with a "category_id" value that does not exist in the "Product_Category" table. This approach ensures data consistency and accuracy, as it guarantees that every product is associated with a valid category.
